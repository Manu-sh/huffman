### Huffman
###### 

Example of format

All integers in little endian:

`uint8_t magic[] { 0x4d, 0x61, 0x6e, 0x75 };` 

`uint8_t reserved[16]`

`uint32_t length` of symbol table

| uint8_t | uint16_t | uint8_t[]  |
----------|----------|-------------
| symbol  | length   | prefix code|

bitstream..


Maybe a crc will be added later there is some space reserved.

##### Special Thanks

A special thanks to [Bill Bird](https://github.com/billbird) from the University of Victoria (Canada), 
who has shared on YouTube his wonderful video playlist on compression algorithms.
I loved the clarity and detail and the passion of his explanations. 

Thanks, Bill.
